# Deno Svelte Starter

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by Deno and SvelteKit.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
deno install
```

## Developing

Start a development server:

```bash
deno task dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab  
deno task dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
deno task build
```

You can preview the production build with `deno task preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an
> [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
